# python-refactoring

You will find three commits in this repository. In the first commit, as the name indicates it "Unique naming usage for all functions", i applied the same naming conventions to all functions in this step, which is lowercase with underscores naming conventions.

In my second comment "Complete Refactored Code", i completely refactored the code in both file yatzy and test_yatzy. i defined new class and new functions so that i could reuse them to remove redundancy in the code.

Finaly, the last commit, it is about readme file.
